# ESP8266 and ESP32 Dark Sky weather client

The DarkSkyWeather_Test example sketch sends collected data to the Serial port for API test. It does not not require a TFT screen.

The TFT_eSPI_Weather example works with the ESP8266 and ESP32, it displays the weather data on a TFT screen.  These examples use anti-aliased fonts and newly created icons:
